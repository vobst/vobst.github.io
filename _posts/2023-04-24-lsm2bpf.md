title: "LSMs Jmp'ing on BPF Trampolines"
---

Back in 2001, the Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem made its way
into the mainline kernel. Almost 10 years ago, in September 2014, the
modern BPF virtual machine (VM) landed in the tree. In late 2019, KP Singh
proposed a patchset that facilitates the creation of modules for the
former that run on the latter - Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation
(KRSI) was born.

But how does kernel control flow transfer in and out of the VM at the
security checkpoints? Originally, this question was raised while
developing a memory forensics tool for detecting BPF-based malware,
but it quickly became a great learning experience about the internals
of the two subsystems. In this post, we will seek an answer to
that first question, and then use it to develop the module that detects such hooks in memory images.

However, before we jump into assembly code, let’s briefly recap on LSMs
and BPF.

### Linux Security Modules
By default, Linux implements
[discretionary access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control).
For example, the owner of a resource is free to grant others access
to it.
```
$ chmod 444 .ssh/id_rsa
```
This is potentially problematic, e.g., on multi-user systems where
users have different security clearances. To implement other access
control policies, e.g.,
[mandatory access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control),
organizations like the National Security Agency (NSA) had to maintain
their own kernel patches.

At the [2001 Kernel Summit](https://lwn.net/2001/features/KernelSummit/)
in San Jose, California, the NSA's Peter
Loscocco presented their Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux); but the
patchset was not merged. However, one year later at the
[Kernel Summit in Ottawa](https://lwn.net/Articles/3467/),
Chris Wright presented the patch that should later become the Linux
Security Module subsystem.

Citing its documentation:
> The LSM framework includes security fields in kernel data structures
and calls to hook functions at critical points in the kernel code to
manage the security fields and to perform access control. It also adds
functions for registering security modules. An interface
/sys/kernel/security/lsm reports a comma separated list of security
modules that are active on the system.
[link](https://docs.kernel.org/security/lsm.html)

The framework is intended to be generic enough to facilitate enforcing
of a wide range of security policies by writing a kernel module that
uses those two primitives. But writing kernel modules is hard,
mistakes might have catastrophic consequences, and the binary blobs only
run on the kernel they were compiled for - but fortunately there is...

### Modern BPF
BPF is a VM inside the Linux kernel. It is used for
running programs in a sandboxed environment within the kernel context.

Programs can be written in C, Rust or even high-level scripting
languages. They are compiled to BPF bytecode, which can be dynamically
loaded into the kernel where it is statically verified before being
compiled to native code. Thus, running BPF programs is safe, in the
sense that a programming mistake won't crash your kernel, as well as
low overhead. Furthermore, type information included in modern kernels
is used to relocate programs before loading, eliminating the need for
compilation on the target system.

By now, the VM is used in many different kernel subsystems, like
networking, tracing, security, cgroups or scheduling. In an effort to
provide a safer kernel programming environment, it is actively being
extended with new features.

### Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation (KRSI)
[This patchset](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-security-module/cover/20200329004356.27286-1-kpsingh@chromium.org/)
added the option to implement the security callbacks
as programs for the BPF VM. For illustration purposes,
we are going to use a very simple security module that aims to detect
and prevent two common malware behaviors. You can find the full source
code [here](https://github.com/vobst/golb-lsm2bpf/blob/master/mini_lsm.bpf.c).

#### Fileless Executions
Using a remote code execution exploit, an attacker might be able to
compromise a process running on a victim's machine. Downloading and
executing a second stage payload without touching the filesystem might
be desirable due to security measures preventing the creation of (executable)
files or to minimize forensic artifacts. While userland exec is a
well-known technique, it is much more convenient to use Linux's memfd
API. To detect such events, we can write the following BPF program and
attach it to the `bprm_creds_for_exec` security hook.
```c
SEC("lsm/bprm_creds_for_exec")
int BPF_PROG(bprm_creds_for_exec , struct linux_binprm* bprm)
{
  int nlink = 0;
  char comm[BPF_MAX_COMM_LEN] = { 0 };
  char path[BPF_MAX_PATH_LEN] = { 0 };

  nlink = bprm->file->f_path.dentry->d_inode->__i_nlink; // [1]
  bpf_d_path(&bprm->file->f_path, path, sizeof(path));

  LOG_INFO("path=%s nlink=%d", path, nlink);

  if (!nlink) {
    bpf_get_current_comm(comm, sizeof(comm));
    LOG_WARN("fileless execution (%s:%lu)", comm, bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns());
    bpf_send_signal(SIGKILL); // [2]
    return 1; // [3]
  }

  return 0;
}
```
This hook is called early during the exec system call and it receives
the file that the process wants to execute.
At [1] we get the number of hard links to this file. If it is zero, we
deny the execution [3] and queue a fatal signal for the process [2].
The latter is necessary since the hook is called before the syscall's
_point-of-no-return_, after which all errors are fatal.

Note: You can use the
[`memfd_exec`](https://github.com/vobst/golb-lsm2bpf/blob/master/memfd_exec.c)
program to test this hook. It also allows you to experiment with the
differences between executing a script starting with #! and an ELF binary.

#### Self-Deletion
Less sophisticated malware might simply try to go memory-resident by
deleting its executable on disk. We can write another BPF program
and attach it to the `inode_unlink` security hook in an attempt to
prevent this behavior.
```c
SEC("lsm/inode_unlink")
int BPF_PROG(inode_unlink, struct inode* inode_dir, struct dentry* dentry)
{
  struct task_struct* current = NULL;
  char comm[BPF_MAX_COMM_LEN] = { 0 };
  const struct inode *exe_inode = NULL, *target_inode = NULL;
  int i = 0;

  target_inode = dentry->d_inode; // [1]

  LOG_INFO("target_inode=0x%lx", target_inode);

  for (i = 0,
      current = bpf_get_current_task_btf(),
      exe_inode = current->mm->exe_file->f_inode; // [2]
      exe_inode && i < BPF_MAX_LOOP_SIZE;
       i++,
      current = BPF_CORE_READ(current, parent),
      exe_inode = BPF_CORE_READ(current, mm, exe_file, f_inode))
  {
    bpf_probe_read_kernel(&comm, sizeof(comm), &current->comm);
    LOG_INFO("exe_inode=0x%lx comm=%s", exe_inode, comm);

    if (target_inode == exe_inode) { // [3]
      bpf_get_current_comm(comm, sizeof(comm));
      LOG_WARN("self-deletion (%s:%lu)", comm, bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns());
      bpf_send_signal(SIGKILL);
      return 1;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
We attach this program to the `inode_unlink` hook, which is called each
time a process attempts to delete a file. The callback receives the
parent directory as well as the directory entry of the file that is to
be deleted. First, the `dentry` is used to obtain the underlying inode
[1]. Then, the loop reads the inode of the file that the process (or
any of its ancestors) is executing [2].
Finally, by comparing the two [3] we can attempt to detect
self-deletions.

Note: This program is flawed in many ways.
First, it breaks updates, e.g., when the package manager updates
systemd's executable. Furthermore, it is easy to bypass, e.g.,
- The parent deletes its child's executable and exits. Then, the child
gets reparented and deletes the parent.
- Schedule removal through another task, e.g., `cron` or `systemd`.
- Use the `prctl` syscall to set the exe file.
- Scripts that are run by an interpreter are unaffected.
- Using `io_uring`'s asynchronous unlink requests in combination with a
dedicated kernel thread for processing them _might_ (not tested) also
be an option.

## BPF Trampolines: The glue between C and BPF
Now that we got ourselves a small BPF-based security module to play
with, we can examine how it works under the hood.

### Reaching the tramp
Let's start by looking at the part of the infrastructure that is
statically compiled into the kernel. Figure 1 gives an overview of
the code path leading up to our BPF program.

![Figure 1: Call chain leading up to BPF trampoline](/media/lsm2bpf/call_chain_to_tramp.jpg)

At selected places, the kernel calls functions starting with
`security_`. For example, the `vfs_unlink` function calls
`security_inode_unlink` and aborts if it returns a nonzero value.
LSM hooks are meant to provide a higher level of abstraction than
system calls; thus it makes sense to pace the gatekeeper call at
a choke point in the virtual file system (VFS) which may operations
must pass, independently of their entry point into the kernel and the
type of object they are operating on.

Each of those call sites has its own member in the global
`security_hook_heads` structure. The `security_inode_unlink` function
uses its member to traverse a list of all registered callbacks, calling
them one by one. As soon as one of them returns a nonzero value it
aborts and propagates the value back to the caller.

There are numerous ways how we can find out where the indirect calls
lead us. For example, we can use `trace-cmd` with the function graph
tracer to record a trace of the functions called during an unlink
system call.
```shell
$ touch /tmp/hax && sudo trace-cmd record -p function_graph \
--max-graph-depth 4 -g do_unlinkat -n "*interrupt*" -n "*irq*" \
-n "capable" -n "*__rcu*" -n "*_spin_*" -v -e "*irq*" -e "*sched*" \
-F /bin/rm /tmp/hax \
&& trace-cmd report trace.dat && sudo trace-cmd reset
...
rm-8004  [011] 17857.021621: funcgraph_entry:                   |      security_inode_unlink() {
rm-8004  [011] 17857.021621: funcgraph_entry:        0.129 us   |        bpf_lsm_inode_unlink();
rm-8004  [011] 17857.021622: funcgraph_exit:         0.436 us   |      }
...
```
Alternatively, we can debug the kernel on a guest VM and set a
breakpoint, e.g., on the function we suspect to be called. Looking at
the backtrace confirms the observation:
```
...
(remote) gef➤  b bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir
Breakpoint 2 at 0xffffffff81230d80: file ./include/linux/lsm_hook_defs.h, line 126.
(remote) gef➤  c
...
(remote) gef➤  bt
#0  bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir (dir=0xffff8880053f63a0, dentry=0xffff888005799480, mode=0x1ed) at ./include/linux/lsm_hook_defs.h:126
#1  0xffffffff814c56d0 in security_inode_mkdir (dir=0xffff8880053f63a0, dentry=0xffff888005799480, mode=0x1ed) at security/security.c:1298
#2  0xffffffff8130488e in vfs_mkdir (mnt_userns=0xffffffff82e4e920 <init_user_ns>, dir=0xffff8880053f63a0, dentry=0xffff888005799480, mode=0x1ed) at fs/namei.c:4029
#3  0xffffffff81304a02 in do_mkdirat (dfd=0xffffff9c, name=0xffff8880075b1000, mode=0x1ed) at fs/namei.c:4061
#4  0xffffffff81304b7d in __do_sys_mkdir (pathname=<optimized out>, mode=<optimized out>) at fs/namei.c:4081
...
```
However, as we can see, the function usually does absolutely nothing.
```
(remote) gef➤  x/5i $rip
=> 0xffffffff81230d80 <bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir>:    endbr64
   0xffffffff81230d84 <bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir+4>:  nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
   0xffffffff81230d89 <bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir+9>:  xor    eax,eax
   0xffffffff81230d8b <bpf_lsm_inode_mkdir+11>: ret
```
It exists for the sole purpose of being _ftrace_ attachable! You might
have spotted the `nop` instruction at the very beginning: this one is
just reserving some space which allows the ftrace framework
to divert control flow by dynamically patching the kernel text.

We can see the patching machinery at work by placing a read-write
watchpoint on the nop’s address before attaching our program. It is hit multiple times during the attachment process, and when everything is
done, the `nop` is replaced by a call to a _BPF trampoline_.

### The Tramp
BPF trampolines are the architecture-dependent glue that connects
native kernel functions to BPF programs. Currently only
[arm64](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.12/source/arch/arm64/net/bpf_jit_comp.c#L1964)
and
[x86](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.12/source/arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c#L2128)
support the generation of BPF trampolines.
Figures 2 and 3 show the stack frame and code of the generated trampoline,
respectively.

![Figure 2: Stack frame of the trampoline](/media/lsm2bpf/tramp_stack_frame.jpg)
![Figure 3: Trampoline used for attaching LSM programs](/media/lsm2bpf/tramp_image.jpg)

Some values are burned into the trampoline upon generation; this
includes pointers to its metadata-holding `struct bpf_tramp_image`
as well as the `struct bpf_prog` of each program it leads up to. Local
variables are stored in the trampolines stack frame, most importantly
the read-only context `ctx` received by the BPF programs lives on this
stack.

The execution of the trampoline begins by grabbing a percpu reference to
itself. Probably to indicate to other code which CPUs are currently
using the trampoline.  (Question: Is it really a
percpu ref? Would be strange to get it while migration is enabled.)

Now comes the part where the trampoline calls into the jit-compiled BPF
programs one by one, handing each program a pointer to the stack-allocated
context holding the directory and the directory entry of the file to be
deleted as well as the return value of the previous BPF program.
While a BPF program is running it enters a read-copy-update (RCU) read-side critical
section and disables migration to other CPUs. Optionally, it might also
measure the execution time of the BPF program.

As soon as a program returns a nonzero value, the trampoline stops invoking
other programs and directly goes to its exit routine. Otherwise, it
calls the original function, i.e., `bpf_lsm_inode_unlink`, for its
side effects and return value once all BPF programs are finished.

Upon exit, the trampoline drops the ref to itself and returns directly
into the `security_inode_unlink` function through an extra lowering of
its stack pointer, propagating either the return value of the last BPF
program or that of the attached function.

Aside:
You probably already guessed that the utility of ftrace and BPF
trampolines are not limited to realizing KRSI.

In fact, we already saw another use of the ftrace framework: it’s the
machinery that drives `trace-cmd`. If you'd `strace` it, you would see
that it's doing most of its magic by reading and writing files in
tracefs, the user space interface of ftrace. Furthermore, ftrace can
also be used by kernel modules to install callbacks into their code.

BPF trampolines on the other hand are used to jump into all kinds of
BPF programs, not only LSM-related ones. Numerous flags are
controlling their generation, and the outcome we described above
is just one combination of those. For instance, you could also
generate trampolines that cannot skip the original function and simply
return to it, or trampolines that call BPF programs after the
original function was executed by the trampoline.

## Digging Through Memory Dumps
Now that we are equipped with some background knowledge, we can get back
to the original question:
Given a memory dump of a system can we reconstruct which BPF LSM hooks
were active?

For this part, we're going to use
[Volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3)
as a memory forensics
framework and implement our feature as a plugin.
You can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3/blob/main/src/plugins/bpf_lsm.py).
However, the techniques are not tied to a specific framework in any way.

First, we have to find out which hooks are active. For that
purpose we can simply disassemble all the `bpf_lsm_` stub functions
and check if their ftrace nops are replaced by a call. This gives us
the active hooks and the corresponding addresses of the executable
trampoline images.

Next, we can figure out which programs belong to a given image. There are
at least two approaches that immediately come to mind: disassemble
the trampolines and extract the compiled-in addresses of the program
code and their corresponding metadata structs, or
query higher-level abstractions like BPF link objects.

While the first approach is less susceptible to anti-forensics it
suffers from dependence on trampoline code generation. Since we already
know which hooks are active it’s safe to look for the program information
at places that are easier to manipulate, like the `link_idr` which
contains all BPF link objects in use. If we don't find a corresponding
program there it's considered suspicious, and we will raise an alert.

Figure 4 gives an overview of how BPF link objects can be used
to match trampoline images to links. Iterating the `link_idr` gives
us `bpf_link` objects. The link type maps directly
the type of the container structure. Thus, if it indicates a tracing
link we can pivot to the outer struct and use its `trampoline` member to
get the address of the executable trampoline image that the link's
program is attached to.

![Figure 4: Matching BPF links to trampolines](/media/lsm2bpf/link_to_tramp.jpg)

Putting it all together, we can find all active BPF LSM hooks as well
as all programs attached to them. You can find the full Volatility
plugin code that implements the above approach in our BPF plugin suite
on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3).
Running it against a memory image of a system that uses our toy LSM
correctly reports activity on two hooks.
```
./vol.py -f /io/dumps/mini_lsm_w_dummy.elf -v linux.bpf_lsm
...
LSM HOOK	Nr. PROGS	IDs

bpf_lsm_bprm_creds_for_exec	2	16,18

bpf_lsm_inode_unlink	1	19
```
Note that we have added a second program to `bprm_creds_for_exec`
in order to cover the case where more than one program is attached to a
single hook. You can now use the
program IDs with other plugins like `bpf_listprogs` to continue your
investigation. The memory image can be downloaded
[here](https://owncloud.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/sAXBW6HycFAqbio)
and the symbols are provided
[here](https://github.com/vobst/golb-lsm2bpf/blob/master/18c2747e19df38432fbfbdf4ed36921c.isf.json).

## Wrapup

In this post, we learned about LSMs, a cornerstone of building
high-security Linux systems, and their programmability through modern
BPF. On the way we met two core parts of Linux's tracing infrastructure:
ftrace and BPF trampolines. In the end, we leveraged this knowledge to
build a memory forensics tool capable of detecting a subtle way in which
malware might infect a system.
